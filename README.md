# Lab: 29 - DjangoX

## Summary:

### follow the repo [DjangoX](https://github.com/wsvincent/djangox) template to create a CRUD project .

### Some of those common tasks areâ€¦

* Create a custom user
* Configure static assets
* Add authentication
* Set up styling
* Install common libraries
* Wire up 3rd party development tools

### Repeating these steps over and over violates the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) rule. So pro developers usually create a skeleton application they use to start off their projects.
